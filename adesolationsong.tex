\beginverse                  
\[Am]Here I sit \[G]at the fire\[F]
                                       
Liquor's bitter flames \[C]warm my languid \[Em7]soul\[Am]
                               
Here I drink alone \[G]and remember\[F]
                                   
A graven life, the \[C]stain of her \[Em7]memory\[Am]
                          
In this cup, \[G]love's poison\[F]
                             
For love is the \[C]poison of \[Em7]life\[Am]
                         
Tip the cup, \[G]feed the fire,\[F]
                                 
And forget about \[C]useless fucking \[Em7]hope...
\endverse

\beginchorus                         
\[Am]Lost in the \[Em7]desolation of \[G]love\[Am]
                        
The \[G]passions we \[F]reap and \[Am]sow
                           
Lost in the \[Em7]desolation of \[G]life\[Am]
                       
This \[G]path that we \[F]walk...

\beginverse
\chordsoff{
Here's to love, the sickness
The great martyr of the soul
Here's to life, the vice
The great herald of misery
In this cup, spiritus frumenti
For this is the nectar of the spirit
Quench the thirst, drown the sorrow
And forget about cold yesterdays...
}
