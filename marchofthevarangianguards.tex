\beginverse                  
The \[Em]sun rose over the \[Am]wasteland                
As \[Em]far as the \[Am]eye can \[Em]see                              
Sand fills the vast plains of \[Am]Serkland                       
It's \[G]vultures jeering at \[H]me                           
But they can \[Em]circle un\[D]til they \[G]drop dead                 
I \[Am]have not come this \[D]far                       
To \[Em]end, but to \[D]pursue my \[C]own \[Am]thread   
To \[H]join The Varangian Guard
\endverse

\beginchorus                 
\[Em]Guards of \[G]glory \[A]and of \[Em]might                     
\[C]Red as \[G]blood and \[D]black as \[H]night                 
\[Em]Flies our \[G]banner \[A]as we \[Hm]marc                               
In the \[C]East, for the king of the \[Em]Greek
\endchorus

\beginverse \chordsoff
There's men of the cross and the hammer
A few of the moon crescent
Men simply searching for glamour
Some concealing their royal descen
{\footnotesize The axe-bearing foreigners they have aptly named us}
All we've come from afar
Diversity is what unites us
We are The Varangian Guard
