# Hello

This is my little **LaTeX** project, it consists of chorded songs and sometimes tablatures, if necessary. Apart from internationally known songs, it features some Czech ones, as well as (semi)original content.

The project is mainly built on packages **songs**, providing the main layout of the whole songbook, and **musixtex**, providing its layout of tablatures.

Since I am but a humble student of coding, this project often half-assedly put together by bits and pieces of code found online, some bits (such as the *\rechorus* and the toc entries) have been created manually, providing the most valuable part of this whole learning experience.

Making this code a repository is yet another part of the learning process.

The whole thing is written in **VSCode**, using the **LaTeX Workshop** extension and their building recipes *(specifically latexmk with option -pdfps instead of -pdf)*.

I like seals and silly cats.
