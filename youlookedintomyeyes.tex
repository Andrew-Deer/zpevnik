\beginverse 
    \[Am]We are here alone \chordsoff
    Only the camp fire
    Shines on your face
    I touched your hand
    But you disappeared
    As the smoke the air
\endverse

\beginchorus
    \[Em]You looked \[G]into my \[Am]eyes

    You have \[C]me \[Em]hypnotized

    And \[G]I do \[Am]what you \[G]want \[Am]to
\endchorus

\beginverse \chordsoff   
We are here alone
Only the moon
And wolves are with us
Fire swallowed
You and your hair were ablazed
But you still laughed loud
\endverse

\beginverse \chordsoff 
I'm alone again
And old pine tree
Asked me, where's your woman?
I said: Shut up
Or I make of you another
Firewood
\endverse
