\[Em]Take it easy, one \[G]way lane,
Rain \[D]slow down hurri\[Em]cane,
Heaven free me, you've my \[G]wings to gain,
Fly \[D]boy, fly away from all the \[Em]pain, \chordsoff
I turn right and I find out I'm wrong,
Left with the feeling that I don't belong,
What don't kill ya' makes you strong,
That's why I do this dance and song,
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Em]But \[D]my \[G]youth flows from the \[C]fountain,
Yet my \[G]age shows signs of re\[D]morse,
But \[G]whoa is me, my blind eyes \[C]can't see,
How the \[G]wind could \[D]change our \[G]course, \[G F# F]
\endchorus

\beginverse \chordsoff
It ain't easy when it's all the same,
Day in day out and I'm to blame,
For all this worries and all this pain,
Fly boy, fly away,
I turn right and I find out I'm wrong,
Left with the feeling that I don't belong,
What don't kill ya' makes you strong,
That's why I do this dance and song,
\endverse

\beginchorus \chordsoff
But my youth flows from the fountain,
Yet my age shows signs of remorse,
But whoa is me, my blind eyes can't see,
How the wind could change our course,\chordson \[F]
And \[C]oh I \[G]feel it,
Don't you \[A]kiss me before I \[G D]go,
